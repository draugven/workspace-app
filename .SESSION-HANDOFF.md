# Session Handoff: Supabase Auth Refactor

## What Just Happened

We completed comprehensive debugging of a critical Supabase auth deadlock bug and documented everything for a fresh implementation.

## Documents Created

### 1. `.REFACTOR-START-HERE.md`
**Read this first** - Quick orientation and implementation checklist

### 2. `.SUPABASE-AUTH-REFACTOR-PLAN.md`
**The complete blueprint** - Exact code patterns, 21-step implementation sequence, success criteria

### 3. Updates to `CLAUDE.md`
- Added "Supabase Auth Anti-Patterns & Best Practices" section (lines 111-175)
- Updated TODO backlog with v0.15.0 features as re-implement tasks (items 11-18)
- Current Status remains v0.14.0 (correct state)

## What's Ready for You

**Git State**: Currently on `main` at commit `a31ecb6` (v0.14.0 - working)

**Implementation Plan**: Complete in `.SUPABASE-AUTH-REFACTOR-PLAN.md`
- Phase 1: Preparation âœ… DONE (anti-patterns docs, TODO updates, cherry-picked changes applied)
- Phase 2: Revert to clean state - START HERE (Step 5 in sequence)
- Phase 3: Implement features with correct patterns
- Phase 4: Testing & validation
- Phase 5: Commit & version bump

**Key References**:
- `Supabase Auth Hanging Promises. Best Practices.md` - External consultant validation
- `.supabase-issue-summary.md` - Our debugging session documentation

## The Core Issue (Summary)

v0.15.0 made AuthProvider callbacks `async` and added `await isUserAdmin()` inside them. This violates official Supabase guidance: "Do not use other Supabase functions in the callback function." Result: circular dependency deadlock where promises hang indefinitely on page refresh.

## The Solution (Summary)

Two separate useEffects:
1. **Fast path**: Auth initialization with getSession() and onAuthStateChange (synchronous only)
2. **Slow path**: Admin status fetch in separate useEffect (non-blocking, runs after auth completes)

## Next Steps When You Start

1. Open `.REFACTOR-START-HERE.md`
2. Read `.SUPABASE-AUTH-REFACTOR-PLAN.md` Phase 2-5
3. Verify git state: `git status` should show on `main` at `a31ecb6`
4. If not, run: `git checkout main && git reset --hard a31ecb6`
5. Follow the 21-step sequence exactly
6. Start with Phase 2.2: Verify clean v0.14.0 state

## Important Context for Claude

**User Preferences**:
1. Singleton pattern â†’ should implement lazy initialization (official Supabase pattern)
2. App metadata approach â†’ use `app_metadata` for roles (eliminates DB query)
3. Timeout protection â†’ implement Promise.race for graceful degradation
4. Middleware â†’ verify it follows official pattern (we had it in investigation branch)
5. Start with anti-pattern docs in CLAUDE.md â†’ âœ… Done

**User's Plan**:
- Revert to v0.14.0
- Note v0.15.0 improvements as TODOs â†’ âœ… Done
- Re-implement with correct patterns
- Clear context and start fresh â†’ You're reading this after context clear

## Critical Success Factors

**Must work**:
- Page refresh (Cmd+R) doesn't hang
- Auth completes before admin check
- Failed admin queries don't crash app

**Must follow**:
- No async in auth callbacks
- Two separate useEffects
- Admin check non-blocking

**Must test**:
- Network throttling (Slow 3G)
- All 145+ tests pass
- Manual checklist in plan

## Files Status

- `src/hooks/use-admin-check.tsx`

**To be modified**:
- `src/components/auth/auth-provider.tsx` - Core refactor
- `src/app/layout.tsx` - Add Navigation
- `src/app/*/page.tsx` - Remove Navigation (props, tasks, notes, admin/invitations)
- `src/components/layout/navigation.tsx` - Use useAuth()
- 3 other components - Use useAuth() instead of useAdminCheck
- `src/components/auth/protected-route.tsx` - Save redirect URL
- `src/app/login/page.tsx` - Handle redirect

## Questions You Might Have

**Q: Should I follow the plan exactly?**
A: Yes. It's comprehensive and tested. No improvisation needed.

**Q: What if something hangs?**
A: Check Phase 4 manual testing. Verify no async in callbacks. Check console logs.

**Q: Can I optimize while implementing?**
A: No. Implement as specified first. Optimizations (JWT claims, app_metadata, lazy init) are in TODO backlog for future.

**Q: What about the investigation branch?**
A: Preserved for reference. Don't merge. All useful code is in the plan.

**Q: Should I run tests frequently?**
A: Yes, after each major change. Final run before commit: `npm test -- --coverage`

**Q: What about those background bash shells?**
A: Kill them all first: `/bashes` then kill each. Start fresh with `npm run cleandev`

## Confidence Check

You should feel confident because:
- âœ… Root cause identified and validated by external consultant
- âœ… Official Supabase patterns documented
- âœ… Complete implementation plan with exact code
- âœ… All v0.15.0 features preserved as TODOs
- âœ… Clean v0.14.0 state to start from
- âœ… Comprehensive testing checklist
- âœ… Success criteria clearly defined

If you don't feel confident after reading the plan, something is wrong. The plan should answer every question.

## Final Note

This is not exploratory work. This is implementing a documented solution to a known problem with official patterns. Follow the blueprint. Test thoroughly. Commit when all criteria pass.

Good luck! ðŸš€
