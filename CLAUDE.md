# Claude Code Configuration

## Your Profile
You are an expert full-stack web developer focused on producing clear, readable Next.js code.
You always use the latest stable versions of Next.js 14, Supabase, TailwindCSS, and TypeScript.

## Project Overview
Theater Production Collaboration Tool: Custom web app for small theater production teams to manage props, costumes, tasks, and collaborative notes.

## Core Features

### Database & Tables
- Requisiten tables with cross-references and customizable views
- Property types: text, date, dropdown, file links, status
- Filter by department, priority, status

### Task Management
- Multi-status todos: Not Started ‚Üí In Progress ‚Üí Done/Blocked
- Department grouping (Bereich/Typ categorization), due dates, assignees
- Drag-and-drop Kanban board + table views with searchable filters
- Text search across titles, descriptions, and tags

### Collaborative Notes
- Real-time rich text editor with conflict detection
- User presence indicators and version tracking

## Tech Stack
- Next.js 14+ (App Router, TypeScript)
- Supabase (PostgreSQL, Auth, Storage, real-time)
- Tailwind CSS + Shadcn/ui
- Tiptap editor, @dnd-kit, Tanstack Table

## Implementation Status

### ‚úÖ Completed Features
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth with protected routes
- **Requisiten**: Complete CRUD with file uploads
- **Task Management**: Interactive Kanban + table with drag-and-drop, assignees, search, department colors
- **Collaborative Notes**: Real-time Tiptap editor with SSR fixes and lock cleanup
- **Database**: Clean schema using Supabase Auth users
- **UI/UX**: Compact design, searchable comboboxes, collapsible filters

### üèóÔ∏è Architecture
- German localization throughout
- Mobile-responsive design
- Dynamic imports for SSR-sensitive components (Tiptap)
- Real-time subscriptions with proper cleanup

## Technical Preferences
- kebab-case component names (my-component.tsx)
- Favor React Server Components
- Minimize client components ('use client')
- Always add loading/error states
- Semantic HTML elements

## Version Management
**Current Version**: `0.2.0`

Follow semantic versioning (SemVer) when creating commits and updating package.json version:

**MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH** - Increment the:
- **MAJOR** version when you make incompatible API changes
- **MINOR** version when you add functionality in a backward compatible manner
- **PATCH** version when you make backward compatible bug fixes

**Version Update Guidelines**:
- Always update `package.json` version number when committing significant changes
- Update the "Current Version" in this CLAUDE.md file to match
- Use conventional commit messages with version context (feat:, fix:, BREAKING CHANGE:)

## General Preferences
- Follow requirements to the letter
- Bug-free, fully functional code
- Readability over performance
- No todos, placeholders, or missing pieces
- Reference file names in responses
- Be concise
- If you do not know the answer, say so
- If you think the question is wrong, say so
- Be critical
- **ALWAYS update the Project Structure section in CLAUDE.md immediately after making any changes to project file organization, folder structure, or file locations**

## Project Structure

### Core App Routes (`src/app/`)
- `page.tsx` - Dashboard/home page
- `items/page.tsx` - Requisiten management
- `tasks/page.tsx` - Task management (Kanban + table)
- `notes/page.tsx` - Collaborative notes
- `login/page.tsx` - Authentication
- `api/users/route.ts` - Users API endpoint (secure auth.users fetching)

### Components (`src/components/`)
- `auth/` - Authentication (AuthProvider, LoginForm, ProtectedRoute)
- `items/` - Requisiten (ItemsTable, ItemForm, ItemDetailDrawer, StatusBadge)
- `tasks/` - Task management (TaskBoard, TasksTable, TaskAddDialog, TaskEditDialog, PriorityBadge, TaskDescriptionEditor)
- `notes/` - Collaborative notes (NoteCard, NoteAddDialog, TiptapEditor + SSR wrapper)
- `files/` - File handling (FileUpload)
- `layout/` - Navigation, Footer (version display)
- `ui/` - Shadcn/ui components (Button, Dialog, Select, Combobox, PageHeader, StatsBar, etc.)

### Core Services (`src/`)
- `lib/supabase.ts` - Supabase client configuration
- `lib/utils.ts` - Utility functions
- `hooks/use-realtime-notes.tsx` - Real-time notes hook
- `types/` - TypeScript definitions (database.ts, index.ts)

### Database & Scripts
- `scripts/database-setup/` - Schema and setup (database-schema.sql, database-setup-complete.sql, supabase-storage-setup.sql, current-database-schema.sql)
- `scripts/data-import/` - Active data utilities (populate-task-tags.sql, cleanup-tasks.sql)
- `scripts/archive/` - Archived/obsolete scripts (cleanup-migration.sql, update-departments.sql, legacy-seed-data/)
- `scripts/` - Processing utilities (parse-todos.js, parse-csv-data.js, run-import.mjs)

## Known Technical Solutions
- **Tiptap SSR**: Use dynamic imports with `ssr: false` and `immediatelyRender: false`
- **Drag-and-drop**: Use @dnd-kit with rectIntersection collision detection
- **Select validation**: Use 'none' placeholder values, convert for database
- **Real-time cleanup**: Avoid `channel.off()` - Supabase channels don't support it
- **Database schema changes**: When adding/removing table columns, ALWAYS update both database schema AND TypeScript types in `src/types/database.ts`
- **Supabase typing workaround**: Use `(supabase as any)` for insert/update operations when TypeScript inference fails (temporary solution until better typing)

## TODO Backlog

### Active Tasks
1. **Archive legacy scripts** - Review and archive remaining obsolete data import/processing scripts
2. **Offline capabilities strategy** - Research and plan options for offline data access

### New Feature Requests
3. ~~**Private content functionality** - Add privacy toggle for notes and tasks (creator-only visibility) in add/edit dialogs~~ ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**
4. ~~**Department assignment for notes** - Add department selection to note edit dialog~~ ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**
5. ~~**Rename Items to Requisiten** - Change "Props" terminology to "Requisiten" throughout (Kost√ºme will be separate later)~~ ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**
6. ~~**Remove Dashboard nav item** - Remove redundant navigation since logo already links to dashboard~~ ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**
7. **Typography and styling updates** - General design improvements (requires input on preferences)
8. **Dark theme implementation** - Add dark mode support (requires input on design approach)
9. **Admin role and deletion** - Implement admin role with delete permissions for notes, tasks, and items
10. **Done task management** - Strategy for completed tasks (hide after X days, archive, etc.)
11. **Mobile UI optimization** - Improve mobile responsiveness across all views
12. **Note versioning review** - Investigate current note version saving and potential usage
13. ~~**Rich text link support** - Add hyperlink functionality to note editor~~ ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**
14. ~~**Task description rich text** - Replace plain text task descriptions with rich text editor~~ ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**
15. **Branding updates** - Replace logo and add custom favicon
16. **Deployment setup** - Prepare and deploy application
17. ~~**German localization** - Translate navigation bar items and dashboard text to German~~ ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**
18. ~~**Improve sign up functionality** - Add display name to the sign in form and persist it to DB. Currently auth.users populates "Display name" property automatically by taking everything in the email before "@". Would be nice to be able to add a custom display name. Also if user is not logged in, display log in mask by default instead of sign up mask~~ ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**
19. **Add task ranking within priority** - Add possibility to rank tasks within one priority. Currently they are ordered by created_at DESC by default. Would be cool to be able to drag and drop them within one column in Kanban view to change rank within one status and priority, and in the table within a priority and status
20. **Real-time data synchronization** - Implement automatic polling/refresh mechanism on Requisiten, Tasks, and Notes pages to display latest updates from other users without requiring manual page refresh. Currently only Notes has real-time updates via Supabase subscriptions
21. **German localization for authentication** - Translate sign in/sign up forms to German (currently in English). Update field labels, buttons, messages, and placeholder text to match the German localization used throughout the rest of the application
