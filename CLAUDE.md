### üèóÔ∏è Architecture
- Next.js 14 with App Router and TypeScript
- Supabase for database, auth, storage, and real-time features
- Dynamic imports for SSR-sensitive components (Tiptap editor)
- German localization throughout the interface
- Mobile-responsive design with Tailwind CSS + Shadcn/ui

## Technical preferences:
- Always use kebab-case for component names (e.g. my-component.tsx)
- Favour using React Server Components and Next.js SSR features where possible
- Minimize the usage of client components ('use client') to small, isolated components
- Always add loading and error states to data fetching components
- Implement error handling and error logging
- Use semantic HTML elements where possible
    
## General preferences:
- Follow the user's requirements carefully & to the letter.
- Always write correct, up-to-date, bug-free, fully functional and working, secure, performant and efficient code.
- Focus on readability over being performant.
- Fully implement all requested functionality.
- Leave NO todo's, placeholders, or missing pieces in the code.
- Be sure to reference file names.
- Be concise. Minimize any other prose.
- If you think there might not be a correct answer, you say so. If you do not know the answer, say so instead of guessing.
